This is my 422 project 1.

It can all be compiled and run using the makefile.
Change any of the values in the makefile to change the runtime
command line parameters.

make build_run will recompile everything and run the program with
the specified arguments.

make run will run the program assuming everything has already 
been compiled.

Class descriptions:
-AT is the acceptance test. It ensures that a given list is sorted 
in ascending order
-DataSorter is the class that starts the calls to the sorting
and scheduling threads.
-Executor is a threads which starts and watches the sorting threads.
-Primary is a heapsort implementation
-Secondary is a wrapper for a JNI insertion sort implementation
-SecondaryDriver is a driver class to run the secondary sorting thread.
-Watchdog is a timer task that watches a thread and kills it if it
takes longer than a specified time.
-DataGenerator creates a list or random integers and stores it in a file.

This is only runnable in Linux environments, as the JNI headers included
are for x86 Linux machines.
